# Dissertation_RecordLinkage

This is the repository for all my code files for the Record Linkage Project in the session 2 of the summer dissertation project (2020) in 
the University of Edinburgh. 

The code files include twomodels.ipynb (where the Siamese LSTM Neural Network and the per-trained BERT Base are built) and sigmoid_plot.R 
(where the sigmoid curve is plotted). Since the picture of the structure of BERT is too large to show in my paper, I also add the 
bertstructure.png file.

I am grateful to the supervisors of the project, Daniel Paulin, Victor Elvira, Aleksander Kolev, for their advice and guidance. At the same 
time, we are very grateful to have help from Grant Galloway (Machine Learning  Scientist, Amazon Development Centre Scotland).
